# Project 5 - Public API Requests

This project uses JavaScript to add make API calls to a random users API and display the data in cards. Users can click the cards to view a modal with additional data, toggle through the cards to view other users, and search for users using the search bar. The background color was also changed. **Aiming for exceeds expectations**.


## Programming Approach

This project uses *jQuery* to interact with the DOM and the *fetch* api to make API calls. *Promise.all()* was used to resolve all API calls before displaying the data. There are many reusable functions to keep the code as DRY and efficient as possible.

## Personalized Styles:

1. A *body* background color was changed to the following: *rgba(24, 161, 240, 0.9)*.

## Syntax and Conventions

The app is written in ES6 JavaScript.
